PROJECT COURSE OF AI
## Summary
This will serve as the central hub for the "Playing Music According to Mood with the Help of AI" project. Its primary purpose is to house the project's source code, documentation, and associated assets. The project's goal is to provide users with a personalized music listening experience by utilizing AI algorithms to recommend tracks based on their current emotional state.
## Background
In an era where music has become an integral part of our daily lives, the quest to discover the perfect soundtrack for every moment is a universal desire. Music can elicit a wide range of emotions and feelings, from uplifting joy to introspective contemplation. What if we could harness the power of artificial intelligence to curate music that resonates with our ever-changing moods?
**Mood Music AI** is an ambitious project that aims to revolutionize the way we experience music. By blending cutting-edge AI technology with our passion for music, we seek to create a platform that understands your emotional state and delivers music that complements it seamlessly.
